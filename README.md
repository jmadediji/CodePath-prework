Submitted by: **Jesutofunmi Adediji**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
Complexity was added to the game by adding texts that spells a color other than the background color of the game buttons (the text is also written in the color of the color printed) .

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[ nn]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[After completing my submission, I am curious to know how big technology and multimedia companies bring all elements of their website together. In this project, CSS, Javascript, and HTML were all incorporated to bring the game alive, and HTML housed the other two. As a result, I am curious as to how the languages, software, and other tools used by different developers(Backend, Frontend, etc) all come together to make one big project.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If I had a few more hours on the project I will spend them adding additional features to the game to make it more interactive with the player. Specifically, I would have added features like a progress bar, a countdown timer, and sound effects. 
A progress bar would be great in the game because it enables the player to know what level they are on and how many levels they have left to win the game. I would have incorporated this element by adding the levels there are in my game (1-10)  and each time a player successfully completes a round, a line is drawn that connects the first number to the next. If the player loses at any round, the line that connects the numbers get erased and the "game over" alert pops up.
Similarly, I would add a timer that indicates how much time a player gets to complete the game. I believe this feature would add a little bit of difficulty and fun to the game. I would have incorporated this feature by setting a time (for example, 2 minutes)that counts down as soon as the player clicks start. If the player runs out of time, the game is lost. Therefore, the game would be coded in a way that the player loses if they play the incorrect pattern or run out of time.
Another interesting feature that would be good in the game is sound effects. I would have made sound effects for when the player loses the game, wins the game, and moves to the next level.
